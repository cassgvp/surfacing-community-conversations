# Developing the vision and mission

## 1. What is the world we wish to see? What are we trying to achieve? Why?
*This is big picture thinking that should lead to your organisation’s or community’s vision and mission.*

### Open Research Map
#### Vision
An essential tool for understanding system change towards the adoption of open research, and efficiently co-locating the reform community.

#### Mission
*A  one-sentence  statement  describing  the  reason your  organisation or program  exists.  (what  you  do +  who/what  you  do  this  for). Made up through combining parts of the below statements.*

##### Actions we will take/produce
- Research and identify outputs, resources, communities, events, actors (collectively "elements") and how they are inter-connected ("connections")
- Facilitate the development of an extensible community-led definition of nomenclature and required metadata to classify elements to make them amenable to system-level mapping
- Build a low-lift tools to extract relevant information from submitted elements 
- Build and engaging and informative visualisation of elements and connections to facilitate communication and analysis of the system, and discoverability of elements
- Build a sustainable community of contributors who feel valued and rewarded
 

##### People we benefit
- Researchers; Policy makers; Funders; Institutions; Communities

##### Services we provide
- Tools 
- Social and technical infrastructure

##### Problems we solve
- Open research is silo'd
- Element/evidence mapping is incomplete and static

##### Causes we support
Diversity; Inclusivity; Openness; Collaboration; dissemination of power

##### Putting it all together
Building technical and social infrastructure for dynamic and extensive mapping of the open research ecosystem.

#### Vision
An essential tool for understanding system change towards the adoption of open research, and efficiently co-locating the reform community.


### Mission and Vision
**Mission**: Supporting the use of inclusive open research practices at WIN to improve human brain health

**Vision**: Open and considered sharing of WIN research outputs

## 2. How, who (with and for whom) and when (on what timescale)?
*These questions will define the overarching method you use to get to your big-picture vision, or your strategy.*
### How
- Create training materials
- Refine processes
- Devise policy and incentives
- Normalise behaviours
- Create behaviour change
- Build community
- Share knowledge

### Who
- Students
- Researchers
- Core staff
- Principle Investigators
- Clinicians

### When
- 2022


## 3. If your vision is your destination, and strategy is the road you’re taking to get there, what will help you move along this road?
*Which vehicle, how will you acquire it and how will you keep it running? A small number of goals that underpin your mission and strategy are your objectives.*

## 4. What does success look like for these objectives?
*Can you express success as a set of key results that are SMART? (SMART to me means Sensible, Measurable, Achievable (but still challenging), Realistic and Time-bound, but there are variants on this.)*

## 5. Which are the activities and tasks — or programming, content and engagement mechanisms — that might help you achieve these key results, and in which order do you need to do them?
*This last step can help you align your short-term work with objectives (and say no) and then evaluate whether this has worked (has your key result become a reality?).*
